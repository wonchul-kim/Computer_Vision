## Vision for pytorch

Pytorch manages and handles dataset with the concept of tensors, which are matrices. I think this is same concept to the tensor used in Tensorflow. However, pytorch is more intutive and easier to see how each of elements work in many operations, becuase we can print out the output of the elements of tensors and output of the operations immediately. (Tensorflow requires many process to check them out right away...)

Moreover, tensor works in the very similar way to numpy including creating, accessing, operating, and so on. Thus, it is also easy to learn.
